# 🎰 Gacha Pull Simulator

A simple Gacha Pull Simulator built using **React**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project features both **5x pulls** and **10x pulls**, with a local counter that records the total number of pulls you've made. It's a fun and minimal gacha experience that runs entirely in your browser.

> 🎨 **All assets (images, sprites, etc.) used in this project are original works created by me.**
